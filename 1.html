<h2>VISION</h2>
<p>We can now newly imagine the residence of the future through commercialized service of housing transaction that applies <strong><u><a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ma7614/topics_website/tech.html" target="_blank">blockchain</u> technology</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Blockchain has solved the problem of information asymmetry using distributed ledger and allowed minimizing the loss of time and financial resources caused by having to go through an intermediary by directly connecting the seller and the buyer.</p>
<img src="blockchain.jpg" width="100%"><p style="margin-top:40px;">In the past, there have been changes of decentralization and disintermediation in the process of commercializing the internet/web and smartphone/ app but these have only altered the form of the intermediary to a platform and have failed to reach the P2P in its truest sense.</p>
<p>BHOM, meaning BLOCKCHAIN HOME, pursues for a P2P housing transaction and reasonable transaction verification.</p>
<p>It is BHOMâ€™s goal to open the era of blockchain commercialization and hasten the moment of trading and leasing residential property using cryptocurrency.</p>
